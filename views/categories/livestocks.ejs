        We invite farmers from across the country to participate in this interactive 
        platform where you can post and sell your livestock and poultry at farm gate prices. 
        If you're looking to sell ruminant animals like live goats, sheep, or cattle, this is the

        turkeys, live broilers, live cockerels, and other poultry birds, are also encouraged to showcase their
         stock. Whether you're selling spent layers or any poultry-related product, this platform is designed 
         to connect you with potential buyers. Additionally, farmers selling poultry products such as 
         eggs and day-old chicks are also welcome to display their offerings for interested buyers.
